## Current
Typed runtime/coordinator snapshot follow-up: keep collapsing `main.py` / `adjutant` / `world_model` runtime assembly onto shared typed views instead of ad hoc dict shaping.

## Queue
Capability prompt truth alignment: make capability-facing context distinguish prereq-satisfied from buildable-now, and surface stale-world, disabled-gateway, low-power, and queue-blocked truth as first-class blockers instead of burying them in generic headers.
Unit-reservation contract surfacing: promote `UnitReservation` state from kernel bookkeeping into capability/runtime/debug surfaces, and tighten cancel/fulfill semantics without removing the current fast-path bootstrap path.
Task triage/debug bundle follow-up: expose deterministic `phase` / `waiting_reason` / `blocker` / `highlights` summaries in task list and replay flows so diagnostics answer “what is this task doing now?” before forcing raw log reading.
Knowledge/planner truth cleanup: keep aligning `experts/knowledge.py` / `experts/planners.py` with the normalized demo capability truth so soft strategy does not overclaim unsupported faction/buildability semantics.
Historical task debug bundle follow-up: keep improving replay/diagnostics so one task can be triaged from structured highlights instead of raw log scrolling.
Test-signal audit follow-up: broader capability/diagnostics E2E coverage still remains, but the bootstrap smoke / adjutant mock-surface gap and several stale assertion surfaces are now closed.
Docs hygiene follow-up: archive stale slice/audit notes in `docs/yu` and keep only actively referenced execution docs at the top level.
