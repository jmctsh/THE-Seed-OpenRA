# OpenRA / RA1 Expert Knowledge Table

## Purpose

This document collects gameplay knowledge that should be stored in Experts and Planner modules instead of leaving the LLM to infer it from raw world state.

Design principle:

- Prefer positive, actionable knowledge.
- Do not teach the model by listing nonexistent options.
- Expert outputs should carry the recommended recovery/action options directly.
- Separate hard facts from soft strategy:
  - Hard facts: unit/building IDs, prerequisites, queue types, power values, radar capability.
  - Soft strategy: opening priorities, scouting priorities, expansion heuristics, when to tech.

## Current State

Current hard knowledge is split across:

- [unit_registry.py](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/unit_registry.py)
- [openra_api/game_api.py](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/openra_api/game_api.py)
- [experts/planners.py](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/experts/planners.py)
- individual Experts such as [experts/economy.py](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/experts/economy.py)

Current gap:

- Experts report blockers, but most signals still carry too little recovery guidance.
- LLM is still inferring too much strategy from partial state.
- Radar, tech progression, and map-control knowledge are not yet modeled as first-class structured knowledge.

## Hard Facts Worth Encoding

| Fact | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POWR` | Small power plant, queue `Building`, prereq `~techlevel.infonly`, provides `anypower`, power `+100` | [structures.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/structures.yaml) |
| `APWR` | Advanced power plant, queue `Building`, prereq `dome`, power `+200` | [structures.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/structures.yaml) |
| `PROC` | Refinery is the economy anchor; `HARV` requires `proc` | [structures.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/structures.yaml), [vehicles.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/vehicles.yaml) |
| `DOME` | Radar Dome requires `proc`; provides radar; reveals more shroud while online | [structures.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/structures.yaml), [player.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/player.yaml) |
| `BARR` / `TENT` | Barracks require `anypower` and unlock infantry queues | [structures.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/structures.yaml) |
| `FIX` | Service depot requires `weap`; `MCV` requires `fix` at medium tech | [structures.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/structures.yaml), [vehicles.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/vehicles.yaml) |
| Low power | OpenRA RA player rules include `LowPowerModifier`; many structures inherit disable-on-low-power traits | [player.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/player.yaml), [defaults.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/defaults.yaml) |
| AI power reserve | OpenRA RA AI keeps excess power margins and explicitly treats `powr,apwr` as power types | [ai.yaml](/Users/kamico/work/theseed/THE-Seed-OpenRA/OpenCodeAlert/mods/ra/rules/ai.yaml) |

## Knowledge To Move Into Experts

| ID | Knowledge | Owner | Priority | Encode As | Source Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Low power is a production blocker. Recovery should recommend currently buildable power structures, not generic free-form advice. | `EconomyExpert` | P0 | `BLOCKED(reason="low_power", recommendation={kind:"power_recovery", options:[...]})` | OpenRA YAML power/prereq facts |
| E2 | Queue ready item pending means the build queue is blocked by an already-finished building waiting for placement. | `EconomyExpert` | P0 | `BLOCKED(reason="queue_ready_item_pending", recommendation={kind:"clear_ready_building"})` | Current runtime behavior |
| E3 | A building task should complete when the structure lands, even if low power begins immediately after. | `EconomyExpert` | P0 | completion-before-block ordering | Live bug from Radar Dome test |
| E4 | Refinery is not just a building; it implies harvester flow and income recovery. | `EconomyExpert` | P0 | `expert_state.econ_role="income_anchor"` and `recommendation.kind="econ_recovery"` | YAML + RA strategy guides |
| E5 | When credits are low, extra refinery / harvester recovery is a valid economic remedy. | `EconomyExpert` + `ProductionAdvisor` | P1 | `recommendation.options=[proc,harv]` depending on prereqs | CnCNet/Sharoma/community guides |
| E6 | Barracks are infantry production infrastructure, not generic tech progression. | `EconomyExpert` | P1 | building-role metadata | YAML prereqs/production |
| E7 | Radar Dome is scouting/awareness infrastructure: minimap/radar + mid-tech gateway + more shroud reveal. | `EconomyExpert` + `ReconExpert` + `Planner` | P0 | building-role metadata `roles=["scouting","tech","awareness"]` | YAML `ProvidesRadar`, shroud reveal; community heuristics |
| E8 | Losing radar should be surfaced as “awareness degraded”, not just a generic structure loss. | `ReconExpert` + `Planner` | P1 | `BLOCKED(reason="radar_missing", impact="reduced_awareness")` | YAML radar capability |
| E9 | Scout unit preference should favor fast expendable mobile units before infantry; harvesters should never be default scouts. | `ReconExpert` | P0 | resource preference policy | OpenRA/RA community scouting heuristics |
| E10 | Base scouting with no target found should close as `partial` with exploration delta, not run forever. | `ReconExpert` | P0 | `TASK_COMPLETE(result="partial", data={explored_pct_delta,...})` | Round 7 live fix |
| E11 | “Attack with no visible enemy” should not silently drift into unrelated economic actions. | `CombatExpert` + `Planner` | P0 | `BLOCKED(reason="no_visible_target", recommendation={kind:"recon_first"})` | Live drift observed |
| E12 | Build placement should favor ore-adjacent refinery placement and sensible base stretch; this is map/econ knowledge, not LLM improvisation. | `EconomyExpert` + future placement planner | P1 | placement policy / score function | RA strategy guides and player heuristics |
| E13 | Openings should be soft templates, not rigid scripts. Standard early pattern is power -> barracks -> refinery -> war factory, then adapt to map and plan. | `ProductionAdvisor` | P1 | weighted opening template, not a hard sequence | CnCNet/community strategy sources |
| E14 | Teching up should consider defense/econ cover, not just “build higher-tier structure now”. | `ProductionAdvisor` | P1 | precondition checklist before tech recommendation | CnCNet discussion |
| E15 | If a harvester is lost and economy must continue, refinery/harvester recovery should be explicit advice. | `ProductionAdvisor` | P1 | `recommendation.kind="econ_recovery"` | CnCNet discussion, RA guides |
| E16 | Power advice must be faction/game-specific and availability-aware. Present what is buildable now, not generic C&C lore. | All Experts that mention recovery | P0 | registry-backed option rendering | User feedback + YAML |

## Recommended Signal Shape

### Example: low power

```json
{
  "kind": "blocked",
  "summary": "电力不足，建议补建发电厂或高级发电厂",
  "expert_state": {
    "phase": "waiting",
    "reason": "low_power",
    "queue_type": "Building"
  },
  "data": {
    "reason": "low_power",
    "queue_type": "Building",
    "recommendation": {
      "kind": "power_recovery",
      "options": [
        {"unit_type": "powr", "display_name": "发电厂"},
        {"unit_type": "apwr", "display_name": "高级发电厂"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: attack with no target

```json
{
  "kind": "blocked",
  "summary": "当前没有可见敌方目标，建议先执行侦察",
  "data": {
    "reason": "no_visible_target",
    "recommendation": {
      "kind": "recon_first",
      "expert_type": "ReconExpert",
      "config_hint": {
        "search_region": "enemy_half",
        "target_type": "base",
        "target_owner": "enemy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Guidance For Implementation

### What should stay in Experts

- Immediate blocker interpretation
- Recovery recommendations tied to concrete game facts
- Unit/building role knowledge
- Queue semantics
- Resource-role semantics

### What should stay in Planner

- High-level sequencing
- Opening adaptation by map/economy state
- Transition rules:
  - econ -> tech
  - tech -> recon
  - recon -> attack

### What should not stay in raw prompt

- Exact buildable power options
- Structure-role facts
- Queue blockage semantics
- “What to do when radar/power/refinery is missing”

## Proposed First Fill Order

1. `EconomyExpert`
   - low power recovery
   - queue blocked / ready item blocked
   - refinery/harvester recovery
   - radar as awareness-tech building
2. `ReconExpert`
   - scout unit preference
   - radar impact on map awareness
   - no-target recon closure and reporting
3. `CombatExpert`
   - no-visible-target fallback
   - defend/hold/harass recommendation boundaries
4. `ProductionAdvisor`
   - opening templates
   - power/econ/tech trade-off heuristics

## Review Questions

1. Should Radar Dome be modeled primarily as `scouting`, `tech`, or both?
2. Should power recovery advice mention only currently buildable options, or also near-term next-tier options?
3. Should refinery placement knowledge live in `EconomyExpert`, or in a separate future `PlacementPlanner`?
4. Do we want a single `knowledge/` directory with YAML, or keep the first version inside Experts as Python rules?
